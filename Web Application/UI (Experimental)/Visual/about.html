      Welcome to Eden Farms! We're an In-Development Smart Verical Farming project with big ambitions and even bigger dreams.  <br/>
      We pride ourselves on using the best available computing, software, machine components and personnel to make our vision a reality - to revolutionize agriculture. <br/>
      Our mission is to create a Smart Vertical Farming system that is capable of efficently farming plants and crops to produce the best fruits, vegetables, dairy products and more, while minimalizing costs, pollution and manual labour.<br/>
      We're still small in scale of... everthing, but just like a plant needs love and care to grow, so will we with the right support. <br/><br/>

      People on the project:<br/>
      Hermann Roets (Project Leader)<br/>
      Anrich van Zyl<br/>
      Hano Taljaard<br/>
      Tiaan Hanekom<br/>
      Phil McCarter<br/>
